                 <p id="paragraph_1"> Hi, my name is Aysen which means <i>happy moon</i> in Turkish. I have a BS degree in Computer Engineering from Dokuz Eylul University in Turkey. 
                    In my senior thesis, I implemented a tic-tac-toe game in Matlab using feed-forward artificial networks and evolutionary techniques, based on the work of Fogel. 
                    Before moving to US, I was a Phd candidate and worked as a teaching and research assistant at Hacettepe University in Turkey. In my master's thesis, I developed a new approach for constructing activity-on-arc networks. 
                    Then I got another master's degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University in 2011. I'm married and have an 8 year old.
                 </p> 
                 <p id="paragraph_2">I learned programming using Pascal at college, then programmed in C, C++ and Java later on. I developed Database Applications with Delphi to Web Applications 
                     with J2EE. It's amazing to see how things in Software World develop and improve with such a rapid pace.
                     I love learning new things. I think what college teaches you is learning how to learn. Well learning never ends. Now I'm learning more about Full Stack Development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as its frameworks.
                     I also do volunteering in my kid's school. I've been a treasurer and volunteer scheduler as well as tutor in her class. I'm an avid reader, I probably have more books than everything else. I love baking with my daughter whenever I find extra time.
